Shell Script for User Management and Backup in Linux:  

✅ This project involves creating a shell script that automates user management tasks  
   and backup processes in a Linux environment.  
    
✅ The primary goal is to enable efficient management of user accounts and secure backup  
   of specified directories.  
    
✅ I implemented features for user account manipulation, group management, and automated  
    backups, enhancing my understanding of Linux system security and file handling.
